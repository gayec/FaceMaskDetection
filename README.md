# Face Mask Detection System
This project checks if people are wearing face masks, gives a warning for people not wearing masks.
While carrying out the project, a pretrained model ’Caffe Implementation’ was used to detect people’s faces. In order to detect face masks, the model was trained with a dataset of 5975 data using ’Convolutional Neural Networks’. After the system detects the face masks, it will give an audible warning as ”Please wear your mask”. Finally, how accurately the system can detect the face mask will be tried and tested in various environments. Test results show that the accuracy of the system can reach up to 88%.
